# Scene Understanding and Scene Synthesis Pipeline

This repository contains the implementation of a Scene Understanding and Scene Synthesis pipeline. The pipeline is designed to analyze and generate complex scenes, leveraging advanced techniques in computer vision and machine learning.

## Repositories

To fully utilize this pipeline, you will need to complement it with the following repositories:

1. **SUSP_ATISS**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/raimonmerce/SUSP_ATISS)
2. **SUSP_CFL**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/raimonmerce/SUSP_CFL)
